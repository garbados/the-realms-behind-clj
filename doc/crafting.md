# Crafting

To produce items, you need the skill, the tools, the workspace, and the recipe:

- The Skill: Usually *Craft*, but some feats allow other skills to be used in some circumstances. As all crafting is specialized, you must have the relevant specialty crafting feat to produce items of different types, such as arms and armor versus alchemical potions.
  - *Smithing*: Arms and armor.
  - *Carving*: Icons, reliefs, jewelry.
  - *Weaving*: Clothing, baskets, etc.
  - *Pottery*: Pots, and the inimitable clay tablet.
  - *Cooking*: Potions and meals.
  - *Imbuing*: Magical enchantments.
- The Tools:
  - Smithing: *Smithing Kit*
  - Carving: *Carving Kit*
  - Weaving: *Tailor's Kit*
  - Pottery: *Potter's Wheel*
  - Cooking: *Mixology Set*
  - Imbuing: *Ley Alembic*
- The Workspace: You'll need space for your tools, and peace. For smithing, you'll need a forge, bellows, etc., which limits the field work smiths are capable of.
- The Recipe: While crafting specialty feats implicitly teach relevant level 1 recipes -- becoming a smith makes it feasible to produce any level 1 equipment -- more esoteric projects will require knowledge that cannot be easily obtained, or which must be sought out especially. Relics, in particular, work this way.
  - Schema: Name, Description, Level, Materials, Tags.

With a recipe decided, you must front the required materials.

- For a recipe of some level, you can only satisfy its requirements with materials of at least that level.
- Three materials of one level can be converted to one material of one level higher. So, a level 3 Leather material can be approximated with nine level 1 Leather materials, or six level 1 and one level 2, or so on and so on. This conversion only happens as materials are being consumed by the work.
- Sometimes, the remainder can be bought in gold from local merchants, but this is not reliably the case.

Next, you must do the work:

- The work requires *steps* equal to the level of the final object ~3x (3, 9, 18, 30, ...).
- Each *Craft* action you complete successfully, satisfies *steps* equal to your successes.

Once all steps are satisfies, the work is complete, and the object is yours.

## *Craft* Action

Players may spend one downtime action to make a check toward a project, flipping Craft against DC 11 + the project's total level. That is, the level of the base item plus any enhancements. Failure satisfies no steps. Critical failure botches the project, forcing you to start over.

Feats may allow you to roll other skills in place of Craft under certain circumstances.

## Enhancing Equipment

Equipment can be enhanced in two ways:

- Masterwork effects: *Only at crafting time*, an object can be crafted to such a high standard that it exhibits distinctive qualities.
- Enchantments: An object can be infused with magical power at crafting time or after. Doing this work during crafting reduces its effective level by one, but renders the object unusable until enchanting is complete.

Enhancements have the following schema:
- Name, Description, Level, Slot, Materials, Tags
  - Tags will include either :masterwork or :enchantment

Enhancements add their level to the level of the base item, resulting in a higher level item that is more difficult and more expensive to craft.

Enchanting work that is done separately from item crafting still uses the base item's level, but halves the resulting steps. That is, imbuing a level 1 weapon with a level 1 enchantment results in half as many steps as making a level 2 object, or 5 (rounded up). The work only requires materials for the enchantment.

## Defects and Curses

The other side of masterworks and enchantments, is defects and curses. They reduce the effective level of the work, thus reducing costs and time, among other things. However, both can only be applied during item creation.

Unless you *want* to curse an item, in which case you should invert the effective level, making more or greater curses more difficult.

While defects are obvious with use, curses must be determined with an Arcana check, or deduced through use.

## Relics

Relics are powerful, little-understood artifacts. They can be designed with the equipment system, and thus theoretically can be crafted, but such recipes have been lost to time and ruin.
