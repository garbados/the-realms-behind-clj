This work is dedicated to an old friend.

Furthermore, it ruthlessly poaches components of his, Stephen Murphy's, sensible designs and innovative adaptations, as demonstrated in his prototypal "Flagon Quest".

I have also borrowed from inspirations such as GURPS and Pathfinder, with some White Wolf for seasoning. My long history with this medium as a hobbyist shows in this system's design, and I hope I have honored my priors with it. Regarding app design, I owe considerable inspiration to [PathBuilder](https://pathbuilder2e.com).

By distributing this project as software, as a website with built-in campaign and player tooling, I propose a role for digital tooling in playing tabletop roleplaying games. The genre's defining feature is human arbitration, exemplified in *Rule Zero*. Computers cannot approximate the totality of human volition, full stop. So why try?

Well, the comprehensive systematic representations that we use to structure our shared mental playgrounds, inevitably boil down to algebra of more or less complexity. Even if its equations are simple enough for a human to do trivially, come on, give yourself the convenience. Give your players the convenience.
