# Bestiary

The party will encounter foes on its travels, and other entities that aren't quite characters. These are *monsters*, crudely said, and they play by different rules.

When designing a monster, you follow these steps:

- Decide the *growth rate* of Health, Defenses, Resists, Skills, and the aggregate *Attack* stat.
- Select any techniques the monster has.
- Select any behaviors the monster has.
- Name and describe the monster, maybe with an image.

These growth rates are used with the monster's *experience level*, a representation of accrued prowess, which is roughly divided into: novice (1), regular (2), veteran (3), elite (4), and legendary (5). Those growth rates are multiplied by this experience level to instantiate a monster.

Techniques and Behaviors may specify an experience range where they apply. That is, a novice or regular goblin raider may be cowardly, but an elite would not be.
