# The Setting

As *TRB* is oriented around experiences in a higher dimension, it can be slotted into any setting where that can be adapted to the cosmology. As an example, the First Realm of Pathfinder's Galarion setting easily maps to the Realms Behind; the Fae Queen is just some powerful fae. Much as *FQ*, *TRB* is intended to be relatively setting-neutral, though the in-game mechanisms of its cosmology poses the danger of influencing player behavior significantly, compared to some more neutral system.

Truly, the Realms Behind have many details unto themselves. They are a system of higher-dimensional planes where timeless spirits conduct a War in Heaven through manipulation of mortal agents. The motives of spirits in this War are as ineffable as divine geometry; whatever understanding one achieves will always be partial and relative. In truth, as the War spans all of Possibility, then it is all struggle in every configuration everywhere everywhen. Spirits move everything; their being is the movement. Perceiving them at all is as much a form of systemic thinking as madness itself. The Realms Behind are just those places where this arcane arcology meets the lands of mortals.

Mortals often become tangled up with spirits whose motives in the War they can roughly comprehend or relate to, but it works the other way around too: a military commander beset by haunting visions gains strange insights from beings eager to use his acumen in their designs, while the commander believes he is using these spirits to pursue his own goals. Both things are true.

Mortals perceive the Realms Behind in a very dream-like fashion. It is not a physical plane and thus all its physical qualities are strictly projected from mortal pretentions. A group stuck in the Realms Behind together will experience the same surroundings, but those surroundings are shaped by their collective character.

Spirits may call you back to the Realms Behind, or you may travel there voluntarily. They may bestow you with geas, shunt you into parallel realities, or capture you within pocket dimensions. You may also encounter spiritual influence in the mundane world, which may lead you back to the Realms Behind.

Regarding voluntary travel: entering the Realms Behind is not easy or obvious. There may be physical gates in your world, or you may have access to a fickle portal spell. Without a firm connection to traverse, you can at best touch the veil, but not cross it. Even the gates you can access may be firmly controlled by some or another coalition of spirits, who have their own interests!
